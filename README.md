# test-repo

## Goals

- Learn how much a non-technical person can build using Codex.

## Experiments

1. Run a simple "hello world" experiment to make sure everything is working.

## Lean Paid Social Funnel

This repo now contains a basic landing page (`index.html`) and a placeholder
privacy policy (`privacy.html`). They serve as a starting point for the lean
paid social funnel described in `LEAN_PLAN.md`.
