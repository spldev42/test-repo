# Lean Paid Social Funnel

This document summarizes key actions for launching a single-page paid social funnel. Follow the priorities sequentially.

## P1: Foundational (Complete before ads)
- Define a clear offer under Â£100 with strong problem/benefit.
- Verify all ad copy and landing page content complies with platform policies and legal requirements.
- Build a mobile-first landing page with matching headline, clear CTA, and social proof.
- Install analytics and ad tracking pixels. **Do not run traffic until these are verified.**

## P2: Launch & Early Optimization
- Start with small daily budgets and monitor CTR, CPC, and conversion rate.
- Improve the landing page based on data (headline, CTA, testimonials, images).
- Rotate new ad creatives and expand audiences only after initial conversions.
- Launch retargeting ads and set up post-conversion emails.

## P3: Scaling & Continuous Improvement
- Increase budgets gradually on proven campaigns.
- Add upsells and gather more testimonials for trust.
- Track CPA, ROAS, and customer lifetime value to guide growth decisions.

**Always document what works and update this plan as you learn.**
